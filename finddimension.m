%% Import data from video file 
%  Our video files are in a *.cine file format which is a binary encoded
%  file type. We already have a way to extract all the information out of
%  it, but please take a look at it.

% The most important variable that is returned here is the raw_image_array.
% This is the "raw" image from the camera. For now, I'll add a way for you
% to convert it to a conventional three color image. The other variables
% are metadata about the video file. These are structure files, kind of
% like dictionaries from Python. Properties can be acessed with typical
% object oriented programming.
